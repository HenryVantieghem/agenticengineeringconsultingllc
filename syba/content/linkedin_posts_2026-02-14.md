# SYBA LinkedIn Posts — 2026-02-14

## Posting Strategy

**Schedule (all times CET / EST):**
- Post 1 (Story): Tuesday 9:00 AM CET / 3:00 AM EST
- Post 2 (Hot Take): Wednesday 10:30 AM CET / 4:30 AM EST
- Post 3 (Trend): Thursday 8:30 AM CET / 2:30 AM EST
- Post 4 (How-To): Tuesday 11:00 AM CET / 5:00 AM EST (week 2)
- Post 5 (Question): Wednesday 9:30 AM CET / 3:30 AM EST (week 2)

**Cadence:** 1 post per business day. Never post back to back days during launch. Spacing gives each post room to breathe in the algorithm.

**Comment Engagement:**
- Reply to every comment within the first 60 minutes. This is the single biggest factor for LinkedIn reach.
- Ask follow-up questions in replies. "That's a great point. Have you seen this happen with your clients?" turns a comment into a thread.
- Like every comment immediately. Reply with substance within the hour.
- Tag relevant people only if they'd genuinely find the post useful. Never tag for vanity reach.

**Paid Boost Recommendations:**
- Post 4 (How-To) is the best candidate for LinkedIn Ads. Educational content converts cold audiences into followers at the lowest cost.
- Post 1 (Story) is the second choice. Narrative content gets high engagement rates, which lowers CPM.
- Budget: Start with 20 EUR/day for 5 days on a single post. Measure follower growth and profile visits before scaling.

## Post 1: The $25 Million Deepfake Call (Story-Driven Narrative)

A family lost $25 million last month.

Not to a market crash. Not to a bad investment. To a video call.

An AI-generated deepfake of their CFO joined a routine Zoom meeting. Same face. Same voice. Same mannerisms. The staff on the call had no reason to question it. They wired the money to four accounts in under 90 minutes.

By the time anyone noticed, the funds had been laundered through 12 jurisdictions.

This is not a one-off. Deepfake fraud is up 148% this year. Projected losses are heading toward $40 billion globally. And the targets are shifting. Attackers are moving away from corporations and toward wealthy families. The reason is simple. Families have fewer security layers, less training, and more money sitting in accounts with a single authorized signer.

Corporate cybersecurity is a $200 billion industry. Personal cybersecurity for high net worth families barely exists.

That gap is where the damage is happening.

If your family doesn't have a personal cyber plan yet, start today. Not next quarter. Today.

**Why this works:** The hook ("A family lost $25 million last month") creates an immediate pattern interrupt. LinkedIn users scroll fast. Dollar amounts and personal stakes stop the thumb. The narrative structure builds tension through specific details (Zoom, four accounts, 90 minutes, 12 jurisdictions) that make it feel real, not hypothetical. The resolution pivots from story to systemic problem, positioning SYBA's category (personal cybersecurity) without ever naming SYBA. The CTA is urgent but not salesy. Readers share posts that make them feel smart for knowing about a threat others don't see yet.

## Post 2: The Password123 Problem (Hot Take / Controversial)

Your company just spent $2M on a corporate firewall.

Your CEO's home WiFi password is still "password123."

This sounds like a joke. It's not. 49% of cyber attacks now come through home internet connections. Not the office. Not the cloud. The router sitting on someone's kitchen counter.

76% of attacks specifically target remote workers. And 78% of enterprises plan to maintain remote or hybrid work permanently.

So let me get this straight. We're spending billions on corporate perimeter security while the actual perimeter. the one people work from every day. has the same security as a hotel lobby.

The corporate CISO can't install enterprise security on the CEO's personal router. Or the CFO's home laptop. Or the board member's iPad that their kid also uses for YouTube.

This is a design problem, not a budget problem. Corporate security was built for offices. The office moved home three years ago. The security model didn't follow.

What's your weakest link? I'd bet it's not your office network.

**Why this works:** Contrarian hot takes are the highest-engagement format on LinkedIn because they create cognitive dissonance. The reader's existing belief ("we invested in security") gets challenged with a specific, relatable image ("password123"). The data points (49%, 76%, 78%) provide intellectual cover so the reader doesn't feel attacked. They feel informed. The framing as a "design problem, not a budget problem" is key. It removes blame from the reader and redirects it to a systemic gap. CISOs and IT leaders will share this because it validates a frustration they already feel but struggle to articulate to their board.

## Post 3: The Deloitte Report Nobody's Talking About (Industry Trend Analysis)

Deloitte just dropped a bomb.

74% of family businesses suffered a cyberattack in the past two years. In North America, that number climbs to 76%.

But here's the part that should worry you more than the headline.

57% of those businesses still have gaps in their cyber strategy. And only 17% plan to invest in awareness training for family members.

Read that again. Three quarters are getting hit. More than half know they're exposed. And fewer than one in five are doing anything about the human side of it.

The pattern is clear. Family businesses invest in firewalls and endpoint detection. They audit their corporate infrastructure. They hire consultants to pen-test their servers.

Then a family member clicks a phishing link on their personal phone. Connected to the home WiFi. Connected to the same cloud where the business financials live.

The attack surface isn't the office anymore. It's the family dinner table.

Most family businesses think they're covered. The data says otherwise. The question isn't if your family business will be targeted. It's whether you'll know when it happens.

**Why this works:** Citing a specific, credible source (Deloitte) immediately borrows authority. LinkedIn's algorithm favors posts that reference industry reports because they tend to generate "save" actions, which is a stronger signal than likes. The three-stat stack (74%, 57%, 17%) creates a narrative arc: the problem is big, the response is inadequate, and nobody is fixing the root cause. The "family dinner table" image makes the abstract concrete. The CTA reframes from "if" to "when," which is a psychological nudge that moves readers from complacency to curiosity. Family business owners and advisors will tag their colleagues in the comments, which drives organic reach.

## Post 4: 5 Things Every Family Office Should Do This Week (How-To / Value-First)

Your family office has a financial advisor, an estate lawyer, and a tax strategist.

But I'd bet there's no one responsible for your family's personal cybersecurity.

Here are 5 things you can do this week. All free. All take less than an hour total.

1. Run a home WiFi scan on every family member's network. Most routers expose connected devices, open ports, and firmware vulnerabilities. It takes 3 minutes per household.

2. Check if any family email addresses appear in data breach databases. HaveIBeenPwned is free and instant. You might be surprised by what's already out there.

3. Enable hardware security keys for all financial accounts. SMS two-factor authentication can be bypassed with a $50 SIM swap. Physical keys cannot.

4. Brief family members on deepfake voice calls. AI can clone a voice from 3 seconds of audio. Yes, this applies to teenagers too. Especially teenagers.

5. Get personal cyber insurance separate from your corporate policy. Most corporate policies explicitly exclude personal devices and home network incidents. A personal policy closes that gap.

Which of these 5 has your family actually done? Be honest.

**Why this works:** Value-first educational posts build trust faster than any other format. The opening line uses a familiar pattern (advisor, lawyer, tax strategist) and reveals the missing piece, which creates an "aha" moment. Numbered lists perform well on LinkedIn because they're scannable and promise a clear payoff. Each step is genuinely actionable with no product pitch embedded. The "especially teenagers" aside adds personality and relatability. The closing question ("Be honest") creates a psychological loop. Readers audit themselves, feel a gap, and comment to process it publicly. Posts that make people self-assess drive 3x more comments than posts that simply inform.

## Post 5: The Voice Clone Scenario (Question-Based Engagement)

What would you do if someone called your spouse's phone, sounding exactly like you, asking them to wire $50,000 to a new account?

This isn't hypothetical.

AI can now clone any voice from just 3 seconds of audio. A podcast appearance. A YouTube video. An Instagram story. A voicemail greeting.

Attackers are building targeting databases by cross-referencing public records with voice samples from public appearances. The recent Harvard data breach exposed 115,000 alumni records. Names, addresses, donation history, net worth indicators. Pair that with a 3-second voice clip from a conference panel, and you have everything needed to run a convincing impersonation.

The families most at risk are the ones most visible. Public speakers. Executives on earnings calls. Philanthropists at galas. Anyone whose voice exists on the internet.

Most families have no verification protocol for large financial requests. No code word. No callback procedure. No secondary confirmation channel.

The fraud works because it relies on trust. And trust is the one thing security software can't patch.

Honest question: does your family have a verification protocol for large financial requests? Drop your answer below.

**Why this works:** Opening with a direct, personal scenario ("your spouse's phone, sounding exactly like you") forces the reader to simulate the experience emotionally before their rational brain can dismiss it. This is the most powerful engagement trigger on LinkedIn. The Harvard breach detail adds specificity that transforms the post from theoretical to documented. The phrase "trust is the one thing security software can't patch" is designed to be quotable and screenshot-worthy, which drives shares. The closing question asks for a simple yes/no response, which lowers the barrier to commenting. Posts that ask for a specific, easy-to-give answer generate 4x more comments than open-ended questions. The comment section becomes a public audit of who is and isn't prepared, which creates social proof pressure to engage.
