## Executive Summary

SYBA is positioned to become the world's first AI Agent Insurance Company — the only company at the intersection of AI agent security, continuous monitoring, and insurance coverage. No competitor occupies this space today.

This document outlines the complete product development strategy, research findings, and implementation roadmap for four new products that transform SYBA from a personal cybersecurity platform into the category-defining company for AI agent protection.

**The opportunity:** Every company deploying AI agents (growing 300%+ YoY) needs security and insurance for those agents. No one is providing it. SYBA will be first.

## Section 1: Market Opportunity — The AI Agent Insurance Gap

### The AI Agent Explosion
- Enterprise AI agent deployments grew **300%+** in 2025
- **78%** of Fortune 500 companies now deploy AI agents
- Global AI agent market projected to reach **$65B by 2028**
- **ZERO** companies offer insurance specifically for AI agent deployments

### Who Feels This Pain?
1. **Law Firms** — AI agents handling privileged client info; one leak = malpractice
2. **Wealth Managers** — Fiduciary duty extends to AI tools making financial decisions
3. **Family Offices** — HNWI data processed by AI agents = high-value target
4. **Insurance Brokers** — Clients asking about AI agent coverage; nothing to sell
5. **Corporate HR** — AI agents processing PII daily with no security
6. **MSPs** — Deploying AI agents for clients with no coverage for failures

### Market Size
- 500,000+ companies deploying AI agents by end of 2026
- $2,000-$10,000 average annual spend per agent
- **TAM: $1B-$5B annually** (and growing rapidly)
