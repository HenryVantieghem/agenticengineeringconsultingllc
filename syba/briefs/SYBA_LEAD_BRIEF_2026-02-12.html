<!-- TOP 5 BELGIUM EXPERTS — DETAILED OUTREACH -->

<h3>Top 5 Belgium Expert Prospects — Full Outreach Packages</h3>

<!-- PROSPECT 1: Jan De Blauwe -->
<div class="prospect-card">
<h4>1. Jan De Blauwe — Chairman, Belgian Cyber Security Coalition / CISO, BNP Paribas Fortis</h4>
<span class="fit-score fit-high">Fit: 10/10</span> <span class="segment-tag">Financial Services</span> <span class="segment-tag">Industry Coalition</span>
<p><strong>Why this is a great SYBA lead:</strong> Jan chairs Belgium's most important public-private cybersecurity partnership AND leads security at one of Belgium's biggest banks. He understands both the corporate cyber risk landscape and the gap in personal/family cyber protection. His endorsement could open doors across the entire Belgian financial sector. SYBA's PwC Scale-up Track recognition gives instant credibility with him.</p>

<div class="email-draft">
<strong>Cold Email Draft</strong><br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Jan — bridging the personal cyber gap for Belgian families<br><br>
Jan,<br><br>
As Chairman of the Belgian Cyber Security Coalition, you've championed the idea that cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility — not just IT departments.<br><br>
Yet there's a gap: while enterprises invest millions in corporate defenses, the families behind those executives remain exposed. 56% more phishing attacks now target high-net-worth individuals, and 49% of cyber incidents stem from home network vulnerabilities.<br><br>
SYBA is the only platform that closes that gap — combining a prevention app, WiFi/device scanning, 24/7 human support, and up to 5M EUR in cyber insurance backed by Chubb and Tokio Marine. We're also the only cybersecurity company selected for PwC Belgium's Scale-up Track in Defence &amp; Resilience.<br><br>
Given your dual role leading both the Coalition and BNP Paribas Fortis security, I'd welcome your perspective on how personal cyber protection fits into Belgium's broader resilience strategy.<br><br>
Would you have 15 minutes for a conversation? <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">Book a time here</a>.<br><br>

<strong>Follow-Up Day 3:</strong><br>
Subject: Re: Jan — bridging the personal cyber gap for Belgian families<br><br>
Jan, quick follow-up — I wanted to share that SYBA recently partnered with Jencap Group for exclusive HNWI distribution in the US, and we're expanding our European presence. Belgian financial institutions like BNP Paribas Fortis are exactly where employee families need protection most. Would love to hear your take. <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">15 min?</a>
</div>

<div class="followup">
<strong>Follow-Up Day 7:</strong><br>
Subject: Belgian banker families — the unprotected attack surface<br><br>
Jan, thought you'd find this relevant: our data shows that executives in financial services are 3x more likely to be targeted through personal devices and home networks. SYBA provides the personal cyber layer that corporate security programs miss — prevention + insurance + 24/7 response, all in one app. Happy to share our approach. <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">Quick call?</a>
</div>

<div class="followup">
<strong>Follow-Up Day 14 (Break-up):</strong><br>
Subject: Last note from me, Jan<br><br>
Jan, I know your schedule leading both the Coalition and BNP Paribas Fortis security is demanding. I won't keep following up, but I wanted to leave you with this: SYBA is building the personal cyber safety net that Belgium's families deserve. If the topic ever becomes relevant — whether for the Coalition's agenda or BNP Paribas Fortis employees — I'm here. Wishing you continued success. — Francis

<!-- PROSPECT 2: Pierre Vanpee -->
<div class="prospect-card">
<h4>2. Pierre Vanpee — Head of Cybersecurity, AG Insurance</h4>
<span class="fit-score fit-high">Fit: 10/10</span> <span class="segment-tag">Insurance</span>
<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierrevanpee">linkedin.com/in/pierrevanpee</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this is a great SYBA lead:</strong> AG Insurance is Belgium's LARGEST insurer. Pierre leads their cybersecurity strategy. If AG Insurance adds SYBA as a product offering to their policyholders, it's a massive distribution channel. He understands insurance + cybersecurity from both sides.</p>

<div class="email-draft">
<strong>Cold Email Draft</strong><br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Pierre — personal cyber insurance as AG Insurance's next product<br><br>
Pierre,<br><br>
As Head of Cybersecurity at Belgium's largest insurer, you see both sides: the corporate cyber risks AG Insurance faces internally, and the emerging demand from policyholders who want personal cyber protection.<br><br>
52 billion EUR was lost to identity theft and fraud globally in 2022. 50% of all Americans were impacted, and Belgium is no exception. Yet most insurance products cover the corporate side — leaving families exposed.<br><br>
SYBA combines a prevention app (WiFi scanning, device monitoring, breach alerts), 24/7 human cyber support, and up to 5M EUR in insurance coverage backed by Chubb and Tokio Marine Highland. We're the only cyber company selected for PwC Belgium's Scale-up Track.<br><br>
Two angles that might interest you: (1) SYBA as an employee cyber benefit for AG Insurance's 4,000+ staff, and (2) SYBA as a product AG Insurance distributes to policyholders.<br><br>

<div class="followup">
<strong>Follow-Up Day 3:</strong> Subject: Re: personal cyber insurance as AG Insurance's next product — Pierre, adding one data point: Jencap Group, a major US specialty insurance distributor, is already our exclusive HNWI distribution partner. Happy to share how Belgian insurers could offer similar personal cyber coverage. <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">Quick chat?</a>
</div>
<div class="followup">
<strong>Follow-Up Day 7:</strong> Subject: How Chubb underwrites personal cyber protection — Pierre, thought you'd appreciate the underwriting angle: Chubb provides up to $5M coverage per family for ransomware, fraud, identity theft, and cyberbullying through SYBA's platform. This is a proven model worth exploring for the Belgian market. <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">15 min?</a>
</div>
<div class="followup">
<strong>Follow-Up Day 14 (Break-up):</strong> Subject: Leaving this with you, Pierre — No more emails from me. If personal cyber insurance ever moves up AG Insurance's product roadmap, SYBA is ready to power it. All the best. — Francis

</div>

<!-- PROSPECT 3: Miguel De Bruycker -->
<div class="prospect-card">
<h4>3. Miguel De Bruycker — Managing Director General, Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB)</h4>
<span class="fit-score fit-high">Fit: 9/10</span> <span class="segment-tag">Government/Regulatory</span>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> miguel.debruycker@ccb.belgium.be | <strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-de-bruycker-870827121">Profile</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this is a great SYBA lead:</strong> Miguel runs Belgium's national cybersecurity authority. A partnership or endorsement from CCB would make SYBA the go-to personal cyber protection platform in Belgium. His focus on citizen cyber resilience aligns perfectly with SYBA's mission.</p>

<div class="email-draft">
<strong>Cold Email Draft</strong><br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> CCB + SYBA — personal cyber resilience for Belgian citizens<br><br>
Director De Bruycker,<br><br>
The CCB has done exceptional work raising Belgium's national cybersecurity posture. Your Cybersecurity Personality Award reflects that leadership.<br><br>
There's an emerging gap we'd like to help address: while enterprises and critical infrastructure strengthen their defenses, Belgian families remain largely unprotected. 37% of teenagers face cyberbullying. 49% of cyber attacks stem from home internet. Seniors lost over 3 billion EUR to cyber fraud in 2023 alone.<br><br>
SYBA is Belgium's own answer to this — a personal cybersecurity platform combining prevention (WiFi scanning, breach monitoring), 24/7 human support, and up to 5M EUR insurance. We're the only cybersecurity company chosen for PwC Belgium's Scale-up Track in Defence &amp; Resilience.<br><br>
Brigitte Vantieghem, our CEO, is Belgian and deeply committed to making personal cybersecurity accessible. We'd be honored to brief you on how SYBA complements CCB's citizen-facing cyber resilience mission.<br><br>
Would 15 minutes work? <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">Book here</a>.<br><br>
With respect,<br>
Francis | SYBA.io
</div>

<div class="followup">
<strong>Day 3:</strong> Reference NIS2 directive implementation and how personal cyber protection supports national compliance goals.<br>
<strong>Day 7:</strong> Share SYBA's approach to citizen cyber education (training plan feature) aligned with CCB's awareness campaigns.<br>
<strong>Day 14:</strong> Graceful break-up offering to be a resource whenever citizen cyber protection is on CCB's agenda.
</div>

<!-- PROSPECT 4: Sebastien Deleersnyder / Toreon -->
<div class="prospect-card">
<h4>4. Sebastien Deleersnyder — Co-founder &amp; CTO, Toreon</h4>
<span class="fit-score fit-high">Fit: 9/10</span> <span class="segment-tag">Cybersecurity Consulting</span>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> seba@deleersnyder.eu | <strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebadele">Profile</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this is a great SYBA lead:</strong> Belgian Cybersecurity Personality of 2022. Toreon is a top Belgian security consultancy. Partnership potential: Toreon could recommend SYBA to their enterprise clients for employee/family cyber protection. OWASP Belgium founder — massive industry network.</p>

<div class="email-draft">
<strong>Cold Email Draft</strong><br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Sebastien — complementing Toreon's enterprise security with personal protection<br><br>
Sebastien,<br><br>
Congratulations on the Belgian Cybersecurity Personality recognition — well deserved for your OWASP contributions and what you've built at Toreon.<br><br>
Here's a pattern we keep seeing: Toreon secures the enterprise perimeter brilliantly, but your clients' executives and employees go home to unprotected WiFi networks. 76% of cyber attacks target remote workers. 49% stem from home internet vulnerabilities.<br><br>
SYBA fills that gap — personal cybersecurity with prevention, 24/7 support, and 5M EUR Chubb-backed insurance. We'd love to explore a referral or partnership model where Toreon recommends SYBA as the "last mile" of personal cyber protection.<br><br>

<!-- PROSPECT 5: Erik Van Buggenhout / NVISO -->
<div class="prospect-card">
<h4>5. Erik Van Buggenhout — Co-Founder &amp; Partner, NVISO Security</h4>
<span class="fit-score fit-high">Fit: 9/10</span> <span class="segment-tag">Cybersecurity Consulting</span> <span class="segment-tag">MSP</span>
<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvanbuggenhout">Profile</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this is a great SYBA lead:</strong> NVISO is Europe's leading pure-play cyber firm with 300+ experts. They serve Belgian banks and critical infrastructure. Partnership channel: NVISO could bundle SYBA for their client organizations as employee/family protection. Erik is also a SANS instructor — industry authority.</p>

<div class="email-draft">
<strong>Cold Email Draft</strong><br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Erik — NVISO + SYBA = enterprise-to-family cyber coverage<br><br>
Erik,<br><br>
What NVISO has built — 300+ cyber experts, trusted by Belgian banks and critical infrastructure — is remarkable. You've proven that Belgian cybersecurity companies can compete at the highest level.<br><br>
We're on a similar mission at SYBA, but on the personal/family side. Our platform gives individuals the same caliber of protection: prevention tools, 24/7 human incident response, and up to 5M EUR insurance backed by Chubb.<br><br>
Imagine offering NVISO clients a complete story: "We secure your enterprise. SYBA secures your people at home." That's the gap — 78% of enterprises have remote workers, and home networks are the #1 entry point.<br><br>
We're also PwC Belgium's Scale-up Track pick in Defence &amp; Resilience. Worth a conversation? <a href="https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min">15 min here</a>.<br><br>

As COO of the largest independent wholesale distributor in the US, you've built Amwins into the go-to platform for specialty insurance. There's a category emerging fast: personal cybersecurity insurance.<br><br>
$52 billion lost to identity theft in 2022. 56% more phishing attacks targeting HNWIs. Yet there's no scalable product combining prevention AND insurance — until now.<br><br>
SYBA delivers a personal cybersecurity platform with up to $5M coverage (underwritten by Chubb), a prevention app, and 24/7 human support. Jencap Group is already our exclusive HNWI distribution partner.<br><br>
