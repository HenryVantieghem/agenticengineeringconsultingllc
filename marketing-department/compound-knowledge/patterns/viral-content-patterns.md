## Pattern 1: The 3-Second Rule

**Principle:** You have 3 seconds to hook someone. If they scroll past, your content is dead.

**What Works:**
- Start with movement (not a static frame)
- Text overlay appears immediately with the hook
- Face close-up (human faces stop scrolling)
- Unexpected visual (pattern interrupt)
- Sound: trending audio or attention-grabbing first note

**What Fails:**
- Logo/brand intro (nobody cares about your brand until you earn attention)
- Slow build-up
- "Hey guys, so today I wanted to..."
- Stock music with generic visuals

## Pattern 2: The Value-First Funnel

**Principle:** 80% value, 20% promotion. Build trust BEFORE selling.

```
Week 1-2: Pure value (tutorials, tips, insights) — build audience
Week 3: Soft mention of product/service in context
Week 4: Direct CTA with social proof
Ongoing: 4:1 ratio (4 value posts : 1 promotional post)
```

## Pattern 3: Platform-Native Content Wins

**Principle:** Content that LOOKS native to the platform gets 3-10x more reach than cross-posted content.

| Platform | Native Looks Like | Cross-Posted Looks Like |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| TikTok | Raw, authentic, trending sounds, text overlays | Polished brand video, no music, logo watermark |
| Instagram | Aesthetic, curated, carousel education | Repurposed TikTok with watermark |
| X/Twitter | Conversational, hot takes, threads | Link + description (killed by algorithm) |
| LinkedIn | Personal story, data insight, leadership | Promotional announcement |

## Pattern 4: The Controversy-to-Authority Pipeline

**Principle:** Controversial takes → engagement → authority → trust → sales.

```
Step 1: Post a contrarian take ("Unpopular opinion: [product category] is a scam")
Step 2: Engagement floods in (agrees/disagrees)
Step 3: Follow up with nuanced explanation + your solution
Step 4: Position yourself as the thoughtful expert
Step 5: Soft CTA to your offering
```

**Warning:** Don't be inflammatory for its own sake. The take must be defensible and lead to your value proposition.

## Pattern 5: Engagement Bait → Algorithm Boost → Reach

**Principle:** Posts with high comment engagement get pushed by algorithms.

**Tactics:**
- End with a question: "What do you think?"
- Create polls/this-or-that comparisons
- Ask for opinions on a trend
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"
- Controversial ranking ("Rank these from best to worst")

**Timing:** Post engagement bait on days when you want algorithm boost for the NEXT day's content post.

## Pattern 6: Series Content Creates Habit

**Principle:** Recurring series → followers return daily → algorithm rewards consistency.

**Examples:**
- "Day [X] of building [product] in public"
- "Product of the week" (e-commerce)
- "Monday marketing tip"
- "Friday fail story"
- "[Industry] news you missed this week"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Cross-posting identical content** — Each platform needs adapted content
2. **Posting without a hook** — No hook = no views, period
3. **Selling before building trust** — Value first, always
4. **Ignoring comments** — Reply to comments = more engagement = more reach
5. **Inconsistent posting** — Algorithm rewards consistency, punishes gaps
6. **Ignoring data** — If something works, do MORE of it. If it fails, stop.
7. **Perfect > Done** — 80% quality posted beats 100% quality never posted
8. **Hashtag stuffing** — Use 5-10 relevant ones, not 30 random ones
