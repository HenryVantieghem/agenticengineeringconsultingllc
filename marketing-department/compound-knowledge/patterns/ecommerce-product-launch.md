## Pattern 1: The TikTok Shop Launch Playbook

```
Day -7: Teaser content ("Something big is coming...")
Day -3: Behind-the-scenes (sourcing, packaging, quality check)
Day -1: "Dropping tomorrow" with countdown
Day 0:  Launch video (demo + special launch offer)
Day 1:  UGC-style review (use Kling AI to generate)
Day 3:  "Already sold X units" (social proof)
Day 7:  Customer testimonial compilation
Day 14: "Back by popular demand" (scarcity + social proof)
```

## Pattern 2: The Alibaba-to-TikTok Pipeline

```
1. Find trending product on TikTok (Apify scrape)
2. Source from Alibaba/Accio (calculate margin: need 3x+ markup)
3. Order sample → create content while waiting
4. Generate AI product videos (Kling) before product arrives
5. Get product → film real UGC content
6. Launch on TikTok Shop + Shopify simultaneously
7. Use TikTok affiliate program (pay creators commission)
8. Scale winners, kill losers (data-driven in 7 days)
```

## Pattern 3: Pricing Psychology

- Always show "Compare at $XX" crossed out (anchoring)
- End prices in .99 for impulse buys, .00 for premium
- Bundle: "Buy 2 get 1 free" (increases AOV)
- Free shipping threshold: set just above average order value
- Limited time: "Launch price: $X (regular: $Y)" with countdown
