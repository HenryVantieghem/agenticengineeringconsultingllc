## Category 1: Crypto & DeFi

### Current Market Snapshot (Feb 12, 2026)

| Asset | Price | Recent Trend |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| BTC | ~$67,200 | Volatile -- dropped to $60K on Feb 5, rebounded to $70K on Feb 6, now holding ~$67K |
| ETH | ~$2,340 | Climbing from weekend lows |
| SOL | ~$80-88 | Peaked near $88 on Feb 8, pulled back ~10% |

**Context**: BTC fell below $80K in early February for the first time since late 2024. Heavy selling hit $145M in liquidations. The market is in a correction/consolidation phase after a strong start to 2026.

### 1A. Funding Rate Arbitrage

**What it is**: Hold long spot + short perpetual futures (or vice versa) across exchanges to collect funding rate payments every 8 hours.

- **Current opportunity**: Perpetual futures basis averages 5-10% annualized ([CoinMetrics data](https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/crypto-arbitrage))
- **Platforms**: [CoinGlass Funding Rate Arbitrage screener](https://www.coinglass.com/FrArbitrage), [ArbitrageScanner](https://arbitragescanner.io/funding-rates), [Loris Tools](https://loris.tools/)
- **Risk level**: Low-medium (market neutral, but exchange risk exists)
- **Capital needed**: $5,000+ to make meaningful returns after fees
- **Key stat**: Research shows potential returns up to 115.9% over six months, though only 40% of top opportunities generate positive returns after transaction costs ([ScienceDirect study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720925000818))
- **Platforms favored**: Pionex and Bybit funding rate arbitrage considered lowest risk
- **Reality check**: In 2026, price discrepancies last seconds, not minutes. Automation is required. Manual arbitrage is largely dead.

**Actionable steps**:
1. Set up accounts on Bybit + Binance (or use Pionex built-in arbitrage bot)
2. Use CoinGlass to monitor funding rate spreads
3. Deploy $5K-$10K into delta-neutral funding rate positions
4. Expected return: 5-15% annualized, market-neutral

### 1B. Stablecoin Yield Farming

**Current best rates** (Feb 2026):

| Platform | Asset | APY | Risk Level |
|----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Ethena (sUSDe) | USDe | ~4.9% (30d avg) | Medium -- delta-neutral but smart contract risk |
| Aave | USDC | ~3.73% | Low -- battle-tested protocol |
| Curve Finance | Various stablecoins | 5-20% | Medium -- depends on pool and CRV boost |
| Pendle (sUSDe) | USDe/sUSDe | ~12% | Medium-high -- additional smart contract risk |
| Tokenized T-Bills | Various | ~4-5% | Lowest -- backed by US Treasuries |

- **Ethena sUSDe**: $3.67B market cap, 4.9% current 30d APY. Can boost to ~12% by depositing in Pendle ([DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/yields))
- **Aave USDC**: 3.73% benchmark, up from 3.56% last week ([The Edge weekly yields report](https://www.the-edge.xyz/p/yields-of-the-week-february-4th))
- **Conservative approach**: Tokenized T-bills (e.g., Ondo Finance, Mountain Protocol) offering ~4-5% with lowest DeFi risk

**Actionable steps**:
1. For safety-first: Deposit USDC into Aave on Ethereum mainnet (~3.7% APY)
2. For higher yield: Stake USDe into sUSDe on Ethena (~4.9%), then deposit sUSDe into Pendle for ~12%
3. Capital needed: Any amount, but gas fees on Ethereum make <$1,000 deposits inefficient

### 1C. Airdrop Farming (February 2026)

**Active opportunities**:

| Project | What to Do | Expected Value |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [LootGo](https://cryptomaniaks.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops-for-february-2026) | Walk-to-earn game, open lootboxes | Low-medium |
| [Rain Protocol](https://cryptomaniaks.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops-for-february-2026) | Trade, deposit, loop on Arbitrum | Medium |
| [Loopscale](https://cryptomaniaks.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops-for-february-2026) | Lend/borrow/loop -- points program active, token launch H1 2026 | Medium-high |
| [SEA Token](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-crypto-airdrops-watch-2026-095648298.html) | 50% supply to community, airdrop in Q1 2026 | High potential |
| [Rainbow Wallet (RNBW)](https://www.bitget.com/academy/top-crypto-airdrops-2026-complete-guide-upcoming-token-distributions-how-to-qualify) | Use wallet, confirmed airdrop | Medium |

### Recent High-Value AI Domain Sales

|--------|-----------|--------|
| AI.com | $70,000,000 | Record-breaking |
| Speed.ai | $165,000 | LegalBrandMarketing |
| Amber.ai | $115,000 | NamePros |

| Certify.ai | $110,000 | NamePros |
| Climb.ai | $100,000 | NamePros |

**Key stat**: AI domains swept the first 13 entries in a row on DNJournal's YTD top sales chart. Median .ai domain sale price: $10,000 ([DNJournal](https://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm)).

### 2026 Domain Trends

- **.ai domain registration prices increasing by $20** ([Domain Name Wire](https://domainnamewire.com/2026/02/02/ai-domain-name-prices-going-up-20/))
- **Hot keywords**: intelligence, agent, model, labs, vision, automation, gen, core
- **.com remains king**, but premium .io, .ai, and .app seeing 30-40% higher average prices ([PowerDomaining](https://powerdomaining.com/2026-domain-market-prediction/))

### How to Get Started

**Tools for finding domains**:
- [SpamZilla](https://www.spamzilla.io/) -- expired domain finder with backlink data (350K+ domains processed daily)
- [Dropl](https://www.dropl.io/) -- find aged domains with traffic and authority
- [Karma.Domains](https://karma.domains/en/domain-list/expired-domains-with-traffic/) -- aggregates expired domains across all major auctions
- [DomCop](https://www.domcop.com/domains/high-semrush-traffic-expired-domains) -- high-traffic expired domains

**Strategy**:
1. Focus on [keyword]ai.com, [keyword].ai, and [industry]agent.com patterns
2. Register domains at $8-15/year on Namecheap or Porkbun
3. List on GoDaddy Auctions, Afternic, or Dan.com
4. Set BIN (Buy It Now) prices at 10-100x registration cost
5. Domain investors consistently earn $3,000-$10,000/month ([FinanceBuzz](https://financebuzz.com/domain-flipping))

**Immediate opportunity**: Look for [verb]ai.com, [noun]agent.com, and [industry]copilot.com patterns that are still available. Registration cost: ~$10. Potential flip value: $500-$10,000+.
