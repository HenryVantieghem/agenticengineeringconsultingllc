**Format:** Loom screen recording over the presentation deck
**Length:** ~220 words / 90 seconds at natural pace
**File:** Open `tutor-vsl-deck.html` in browser, full-screen, advance slides as noted

---

## HOOK (0-10 sec)
**[SCREEN: Slide 1 — Title slide]**

> "The best tutors in the world make a thousand dollars an hour. The average tutor makes forty. Same skill — completely different system."

**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 2 — The Gap]**

*Delivery: Pause after "forty." Let it land. Then "same skill" slower, with emphasis on "system."*

---

## PROBLEM (10-25 sec)
**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 3 — The Problem]**

> "Here's the truth nobody tells you: you're incredible at teaching — but you're spending all your time doing it. No time to market. No content system. Totally dependent on referrals. And you're capped — forty hours a week, that's your ceiling. You're trading hours for dollars, and there's no way to scale that."

*Delivery: Conversational, empathetic. You've been there. Lean into "that's your ceiling."*

---

## SOLUTION (25-50 sec)
**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 4 — The System]**

> "The tutors earning millions figured out something different. They built three things: a content engine that runs daily, a lead funnel that captures interest while they sleep, and automated outreach that turns viewers into paying students."

**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 5 — Case Studies]**

> "Ali Abdaal sells a one-dollar course that converts into a thousand-dollar program — five to six million a year with eighteen staff. The Organic Chemistry Tutor has videos from 2018 still pulling twenty-five million views a month. Steven Menking charges a thousand dollars an hour and only works twenty-five hours a week."

*Delivery: Rattle off the stats with energy. These are proof points, not a lecture.*

---

## PROOF (50-70 sec)
**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 6 — The Market]**

> "This isn't a niche — this is a twelve-point-eight billion dollar market growing at fourteen percent a year. AI is disrupting basic tutoring, but it's creating a massive opportunity for tutors who build a brand. The ones with content, with a funnel, with a system — they win."

*Delivery: Slow down on "they win." Confident. Certain.*

---

## CTA (70-90 sec)
**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 7 — What You Get]**

> "I built the exact system that does this for tutors. Every day you get scripts, presentations, captions, and a posting schedule — all researched, all written, all ready to go. You just hit record."

**[SCREEN: Advance to Slide 8 — CTA with Calendly link]**

> "Book fifteen minutes with me. I'll show you exactly what your system looks like — your niche, your content plan, your funnel. No pitch, just the blueprint. Link's right here."

*Delivery: Direct. No hedging. Point at the Calendly link on screen.*
