2. **Government contract intelligence** is a massive underserved market -- USASpending MCP exists but no one is productizing it
3. **Review management dashboards** for local businesses are commoditized, but AI-powered ones (automated response + sentiment analysis + competitor comparison) barely exist
4. **Court records + new business filings** as trigger events -- almost no one does this systematically

### Y Combinator Trends (2025-2026)
- 50%+ of YC Spring 2025 batch was agentic AI
- 1,432 AI startups funded, 247 focused on Generative AI
- 126 API-focused startups -- many in data enrichment and search
- Biggest categories: Business Operations, Sales & Marketing, Software Development, Data Analysis
