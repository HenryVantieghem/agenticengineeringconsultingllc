## Executive Summary

This brief analyzes the top 5 highest-earning independent online tutors, their business models, content strategies, tech stacks, and conversion funnels. The online tutoring market is $12.8 billion (2025) and growing at 14.5% CAGR, projected to exceed $25B by 2030.

### Key Finding: The 7 Scaling Levers

The difference between $10K/month tutors and $100K/month tutors comes down to seven principles:

1. **Stop selling time, start selling outcomes** — Package knowledge into courses with fixed pricing
2. **Build a media brand, not a tutoring practice** — YouTube/TikTok = free lead gen at scale
3. **Own your email list** — The only asset you truly own
4. **Use the $1 micro-commitment** — Ali Abdaal's $1 course converts skeptics into $995 buyers
5. **Create evergreen content** — Videos from 2018 still generate millions of views in 2026
6. **Target a painful, specific problem** — Specificity commands premium pricing
7. **Let media amplify you** — A compelling narrative beats a marketing budget
