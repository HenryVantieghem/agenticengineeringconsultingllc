## Post 1 — "Save 200+ Hours"

I spent 8 months building the same code over and over.

Auth screens. Onboarding flows. Payment integration. Push notifications. Dark mode. Profile pages. Settings screens.

Every single app. The same 15 screens. The same 200+ hours of boilerplate.

Then I asked myself a simple question:

What if I never had to build those screens again?

So I built ExpoLaunch and SwiftLaunch.

--

ExpoLaunch is a React Native starter kit built on Expo, Supabase, and RevenueCat.

SwiftLaunch is the SwiftUI equivalent — built on Supabase and StoreKit 2.

Both come with:

- 15+ production-ready screens
- Full authentication (Email, Apple, Google)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Real-time data sync
- Push notifications
- Dark mode and light mode
- TypeScript / Swift Concurrency throughout
- CI/CD pipelines configured
- Supabase migrations included

Setup time? About 15 minutes.

--

Here is who this is for:

If you are a solo developer who wants to validate an idea fast — this saves you weeks.

If you run an agency and need to spin up client apps quickly — this is your new starting point.

If you are a CTO evaluating build-vs-buy for your MVP — this is the "build" option that feels like "buy."

--

What you actually get:

Private GitHub repo access with the full source code. No obfuscation, no hidden dependencies, no recurring fees. You own it. Use it for unlimited projects.

I am not selling a SaaS. I am selling a head start.

--

The price is $149. One-time. No subscription.

That is less than a single hour of senior developer time in most markets.

Compared to 200+ hours of setup work? It is genuinely the best ROI decision you can make before writing a single line of your own code.

## Post 2 — "Ship in Days Not Months"

A founder messaged me last week:

"I have been building my app for 4 months and I still do not have payments working."

I hear this constantly.

Not because developers are slow. Because the infrastructure tax on mobile apps is brutal.

--

Think about what a "simple" app actually needs before you write a single feature:

Authentication (email, social, sessions, token refresh)
Onboarding (carousel, permissions, state tracking)
Payments (StoreKit or RevenueCat, paywalls, entitlements, receipts)
Push notifications (APNs or Expo, token management, deep links)
Real-time data (WebSocket setup, presence, conflict resolution)
Profile management (avatar upload, edit flows, storage)
Settings (theme toggle, notification prefs, account management)
Error handling (boundaries, retry logic, offline states)
Loading states (skeleton screens, placeholders)
Navigation (type-safe routing, deep linking)
CI/CD (build pipelines, code signing, store metadata)

That is easily 200+ hours of work. And none of it is your app.

--

I built ExpoLaunch and SwiftLaunch to eliminate that entire phase.

ExpoLaunch covers the React Native stack: Expo SDK 52+, Supabase, RevenueCat, NativeWind, Zustand, TypeScript.

SwiftLaunch covers native iOS: SwiftUI (iOS 18+), Supabase Swift SDK, StoreKit 2, @Observable, WidgetKit, async/await.

Both ship with 15+ screens, full auth, payments, push, real-time, dark mode, and CI/CD — all pre-wired and production-tested.

Clone. Configure. Ship.

--

This is not a tutorial project. It is not a "starter" that you outgrow in a week.

These are the same patterns and architectures I use in production apps. Row-level security policies. Optimistic updates. Offline-first data handling. App Store-ready metadata.

The goal is simple: you should be working on YOUR features within 2 hours of purchase, not fighting infrastructure.

--

$149. One-time. Unlimited projects. Full source code ownership.

What would you build if the first 200 hours were already done?

## Post 3 — "Built with the Latest Stack"

Hot take: most mobile app templates are outdated the day they launch.

They use deprecated APIs. They skip modern patterns. They cut corners on the parts that matter most in production.

I built ExpoLaunch and SwiftLaunch differently.

--

ExpoLaunch stack decisions:

Expo SDK 52+ (not bare React Native — Expo is the way now)
Expo Router for file-based routing (the React Native equivalent of Next.js)
Supabase for everything backend (auth, database, storage, realtime, edge functions)
RevenueCat for payments (handles both App Store and Play Store)
NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS in React Native — yes, it works great)
Zustand for state management (goodbye Redux boilerplate)
TypeScript throughout (not optional, not partial — everything is typed)

--

SwiftLaunch stack decisions:

SwiftUI with iOS 18+ as minimum (leveraging the latest APIs, no UIKit bridges)
MVVM with @Observable macro (Swift 5.9+ — cleaner than ObservableObject)
async/await everywhere (no more Combine chains for simple async work)
Supabase Swift SDK (official, well-maintained, type-safe)
StoreKit 2 (modern subscription API, not the legacy StoreKit)
WidgetKit integration (home screen widgets are a retention play most templates ignore)
NavigationStack with type-safe routing (no string-based navigation)

--

Why these choices matter:

Every technology in both kits is actively maintained and gaining adoption in 2026. Nothing is deprecated. Nothing is on life support.

When Apple or Google ships new APIs, these templates are built on foundations that adopt them — not fight them.

--

Beyond the stack, both kits include the boring-but-critical production details:

Row-level security policies on every Supabase table
ESLint / SwiftLint configured and enforced
CI/CD pipelines ready (EAS Build / Xcode Cloud)
App Store and Play Store submission metadata
Error boundaries and retry logic
Skeleton loading states
Empty state screens
Haptic feedback

These are the things that separate a demo from a shipped product. And they are all done for you.

--

$149 per kit. One-time purchase. Full source code. Unlimited projects.
