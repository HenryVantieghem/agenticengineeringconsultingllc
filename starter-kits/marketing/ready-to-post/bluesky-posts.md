## Post 1 — Build in Public Hook

I got tired of rebuilding auth, payments, and push notifications every time I started a new app.

So I built ExpoLaunch — a React Native starter kit with 15+ screens, Supabase, RevenueCat, and dark mode. All pre-wired.

$149. Ship in days, not months.

## Post 2 — Problem-First Hook

Unpopular opinion: the hardest part of building an app isn't your idea. It's the 200 hours of boilerplate before you even get to it.

ExpoLaunch and SwiftLaunch handle that part. $149, 15 min setup.

## Post 3 — Speed Demo

Started a new app at 9am. By 11am I had auth, payments, push notifications, real-time data, and dark mode working.

That's ExpoLaunch. React Native + Expo + Supabase + RevenueCat. Everything pre-built.

## Post 4 — SwiftUI Feature Highlight

SwiftLaunch ships with things most SwiftUI templates skip:

- StoreKit 2 subscriptions
- WidgetKit integration
- @Observable + async/await
- Supabase real-time
- APNs push

$149. iOS 18+. Production-ready.

## Post 5 — Dual Product Awareness

Two starter kits. One mission: stop rebuilding the same 15 screens.

ExpoLaunch = React Native + Expo + Supabase + RevenueCat
SwiftLaunch = SwiftUI + Supabase + StoreKit 2

Both $149. Both ship with auth, payments, push, dark mode, and CI/CD.
