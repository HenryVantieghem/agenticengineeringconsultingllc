### Maker Comment (First Comment)

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Henry, and I built these starter kits after spending months rebuilding the same infrastructure for every new mobile app.

Here's the problem: every app needs auth, payments, push notifications, a profile screen, settings, onboarding, and dark mode. That's easily 200+ hours of work before you write a single line of your actual app logic.

ExpoLaunch and SwiftLaunch eliminate that entire phase.

**ExpoLaunch** is for React Native developers:
- Expo SDK 52+ with Expo Router
- Supabase (auth, database, storage, realtime)
- RevenueCat (subscriptions + IAP)
- NativeWind + Zustand + TypeScript
- 15+ production-ready screens

**SwiftLaunch** is for native iOS developers:
- SwiftUI (iOS 18+) with @Observable
- Supabase Swift SDK
- StoreKit 2 (native subscriptions)
- WidgetKit integration
- async/await + MVVM architecture
- 15+ production-ready screens

Both are $149 one-time. Full source code. Unlimited projects. No recurring fees.

The setup takes about 15 minutes: clone, create a Supabase project, run migrations, add your env vars, and you're running.

I built these with the latest 2026 stack — no deprecated APIs, no legacy patterns. Everything is actively maintained and gaining adoption.

Happy to answer any questions about the architecture, stack choices, or how to customize the templates for your specific use case!

## Option B: Separate Launches

### Launch 1: ExpoLaunch

**Product Name:** ExpoLaunch

**Tagline (60 chars max):**
React Native starter kit. Auth, payments, push. Ship fast.

**Short Description (260 chars max):**
Production-ready Expo + Supabase + RevenueCat template. 15+ screens with auth (email, Apple, Google), payments, real-time data, push notifications, dark mode, and TypeScript. Supabase migrations included. $149 one-time. Go from clone to App Store in days.

**Topics/Tags:**
- Developer Tools
- React Native
- Open Source
- Mobile Apps
- Boilerplate

**Maker Comment:**

Hey PH! I'm Henry.

I kept rebuilding the same 15 screens for every React Native app — auth, onboarding, payments, profile, settings. That's 200+ hours of infrastructure before you write a single feature.

ExpoLaunch eliminates that. It's a production-ready React Native template built on:

- Expo SDK 52+ (Expo Router for file-based navigation)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, auth, storage, realtime, edge functions)
- RevenueCat (App Store + Play Store subscriptions)
- NativeWind (Tailwind CSS in React Native)
- Zustand for state management
- Full TypeScript

You get 15+ screens with dark mode, haptic feedback, skeleton loading states, error boundaries, RLS policies, and CI/CD with EAS Build. Setup takes about 15 minutes.

$149 one-time. Full source code. No subscription, no per-project licensing. Use it for as many apps as you want.

I'm also working on SwiftLaunch (SwiftUI + StoreKit 2 version) — launching that separately soon.

Happy to answer any questions about the stack or architecture!

### Launch 2: SwiftLaunch (1-2 weeks later)

**Product Name:** SwiftLaunch

**Tagline (60 chars max):**
SwiftUI starter kit. StoreKit 2, widgets, auth. Ship fast.

**Short Description (260 chars max):**
Production-ready SwiftUI + Supabase + StoreKit 2 template. 15+ screens with auth, native subscriptions, WidgetKit, push, and dark mode. @Observable + async/await + MVVM. iOS 18+. $149 one-time. From Xcode to App Store in days, not months.

**Topics/Tags:**
- Developer Tools
- SwiftUI
- iOS
- Mobile Apps
- Boilerplate

**Maker Comment:**

Hey PH! I'm Henry. Last week I launched ExpoLaunch (React Native starter kit) and the response was incredible. Today I'm launching the native iOS counterpart.

SwiftLaunch is a production-ready SwiftUI template for developers who want to ship iOS apps fast without sacrificing code quality.

The stack:
- SwiftUI targeting iOS 18+
- @Observable macro (Swift 5.9+) — cleaner than ObservableObject
- Supabase Swift SDK for the entire backend
- StoreKit 2 for native subscriptions — no third-party payment SDK needed
- WidgetKit integration with deep linking (most templates skip this)
- APNs for push notifications
- NavigationStack with type-safe routing
- async/await throughout

You get 15+ screens: onboarding, auth (email + Apple), home feed, profile with PhotosPicker, settings, paywall, notification center, search, detail views, and more.

Everything follows MVVM. SwiftLint is pre-configured. Xcode Cloud CI/CD is ready. App Store metadata templates are included.

$149. One-time. Full source code. Unlimited projects.

The thing I'm most proud of: the StoreKit 2 implementation and the WidgetKit integration. Both are production-tested and follow Apple's latest best practices.

Questions? Ask away!
