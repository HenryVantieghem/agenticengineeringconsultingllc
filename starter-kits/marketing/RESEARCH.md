## 3. The Developer Marketing Funnel

**Stage 1: Exploration** — Be present on HN, SO, Reddit, Dev.to, Twitter. Plain language, no jargon.
**Stage 2: Demo** — Working sample apps, quickstart guides, video tutorials. Show real functionality.
**Stage 3: Conversion** — Use case pages, ROI calculators, testimonials, clear pricing.

### Free-to-Paid Pipeline
1. Give away free tools that solve real problems
2. Build trust through genuine helpfulness
3. GitHub stars / newsletter signups are leading indicators
4. Best leads come from the free tool, not the pricing page

---

## 4. Proven YouTube Video Formats

1. **"I built X in Y hours"** — Show finished product first, then rewind (highest performing)
2. **Revenue transparency** — "How I make $X/month selling code" (drives clicks)
3. **Before/After** — Building without vs. with a boilerplate (makes value visceral)
4. **Tutorial walkthroughs** — "Launch your first app in 30 minutes" (SEO gold)
5. **Tech stack breakdowns** — "My $100K/month tech stack" (developers love this)
6. **Product launch live** — Build-in-public energy, real-time excitement
7. **Comparison/review** — "ShipFast vs Supastarter vs from scratch" (honest = trust)

### Video Structure Formula
- **Hook (0-10s)**: Numbers, bold claim, or visual payoff
- **Problem (10-30s)**: "Building from scratch takes months..."
- **Solution tease (30-60s)**: "What if you could ship in a weekend?"
- **Demo (bulk)**: Screen recording of actual building
- **Results (near end)**: Revenue, user count, testimonials
- **CTA (final 15s)**: Link to product

## 5. The Marc Lou Formula (Distilled)

1. Build personal brand FIRST — product sells through you
2. Tweet daily, video weekly, newsletter weekly — consistency compounds
3. Be radically transparent — share revenue, failures, lessons
4. Build free tools that funnel to paid products
5. Launch on Product Hunt repeatedly — every major feature
6. One-time pricing with lifetime updates
7. Cross-promote everything in footers and CTAs
8. Memorable slogan + visual identity
9. Viral demo videos — entertainment > feature lists
10. Raise prices over time, announce publicly (FOMO)
