**Target length:** 85–90 seconds (~240 words)

## THE SCRIPT

### HOOK (0–10 sec)

[SCREEN: SYBA leads table, scrolled to show 10+ rows with fit scores and colored badges]

"This is what ten scored, researched leads look like when they hit your dashboard every morning — before you've even had your coffee."

---

### PROBLEM + ANCHOR (10–25 sec)

[SCREEN: Stay on leads table, slowly scroll down]

"Right now you're probably paying twelve hundred a month for HubSpot, Apollo, maybe ZoomInfo — and you're still Googling for prospects. Three tools, three logins, three hours a day. I know because that's exactly what my first client was doing before we replaced all of it with this."

---

### DEMO (25–60 sec)

[SCREEN: Leads table — hover over fit score column, region badges]

"This is a live dashboard I built for a cybersecurity client. Fifty leads in forty-eight hours across six customer segments and three regions. Every morning, ten-plus new leads land here — scored one through ten on ideal customer fit. Filter by region, segment, whatever you need."

*(2 sec pause — let the screen breathe)*

[SCREEN: Click into a lead detail page — show prospect brief]

"Click any lead — full intelligence package. Why this person needs your services right now, their pain points, the trigger event that makes today the right day to reach out."

[SCREEN: Scroll to cold email + follow-up sequences]

"Below that, a cold email ready to send. Follow-ups for Day 3, 7, and 14. You don't write a word."

[SCREEN: Navigate to briefings page — show latest daily briefing]

"And every morning, a daily briefing — your hottest leads, what's moving in your industry, exactly who to call first."

---

### BRIDGE + SOCIAL PROOF (60–75 sec)

[SCREEN: Back to leads table overview]

"This one's for cybersecurity. But the system works the same for dental, law, HVAC — any industry. My client cancelled HubSpot, cancelled Apollo, cancelled ZoomInfo. One dashboard replaced three subscriptions and saved them thirty-six hundred a year — before counting the hours they got back."

---

### CTA + SCARCITY (75–90 sec)

[SCREEN: Show Calendly booking page]

"Those five leads I sent you? Free sample of exactly this. Imagine twenty of those every morning, scored, ranked, outreach ready to go. Forty-eight hours to set up. Three hundred bucks, two hundred a month. I'm only taking the first ten businesses in each city — book fifteen minutes, link's in the email, and I'll show you exactly what yours would look like."

## DELIVERY NOTES

- **Energy:** Confident and casual, like showing a friend something cool you built. Not salesy.
- **Pace:** Slightly faster during the hook (urgency), slow down during the demo (let them absorb), speed back up for the CTA (momentum).
- **Pauses:** Pause 1–2 seconds after "had your coffee" — let the visual sell. Pause again after "you don't write a word." Pause after "thirty-six hundred a year."
- **Eye contact:** Look at the camera during the hook and CTA. Look at the screen during the demo — that's natural when you're walking someone through it.
- **Mouse movement:** Slow and deliberate. Hover over fit scores, highlight key numbers. Never click frantically.
- **Face cam:** Small, bottom-right. The dashboard is the star, not your face.
- **Record two takes.** First take is warmup. Second take is the one you ship.

## KEY MARKETING PSYCHOLOGY ELEMENTS

1. **Anchoring:** "$1,200/mo for HubSpot + Apollo + ZoomInfo" → makes $200/mo feel like a steal
2. **Social proof:** Real numbers from a real client (50 leads, 6 segments, 3 regions, 48 hours)
3. **Tool replacement:** "Cancelled HubSpot, cancelled Apollo, cancelled ZoomInfo" — rule of three
4. **Scarcity:** "First 10 businesses in each city" — creates urgency without being fake
5. **Reciprocity:** "Those five leads I sent you? Free" — they already received value

## THUMBNAIL SUGGESTION

Screenshot of the SYBA leads table with bold text overlay:

> **"10 Scored Leads. Every Morning. On Autopilot."**

Dark dashboard background so the text pops. No face on the thumbnail — the dashboard IS the hook.
