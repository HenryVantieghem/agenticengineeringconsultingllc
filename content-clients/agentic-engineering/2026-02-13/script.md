I just saved a client $3,600/year.

Not by negotiating contracts. Not by finding coupons. I replaced three tools — HubSpot, Apollo, and ZoomInfo — with one AI-powered dashboard that costs $200/mo.

Here's the real number that matters: 50 fully researched leads delivered in 48 hours. Not just names and emails. Each lead came with a fit score, trigger events (why NOW is the right time to reach out), a personalized cold email, and a 3-step follow-up sequence. Six ICP segments across three regions.

The dirty secret of the sales tool industry? You're paying for data access. But data without context is just a spreadsheet. What local businesses actually need is intelligence — who to contact, why now, and what to say.

That's what we built. One dashboard. One monthly cost. Better results than a $1,200/mo tech stack.

If you're running a dental practice, law firm, HVAC company, or medical office and you're still manually prospecting — what's the biggest bottleneck in your lead gen right now?

My client was paying $1,200/mo for HubSpot + Apollo + ZoomInfo.

I replaced all three with one AI dashboard for $200/mo.

Here's exactly what happened (with real numbers):

**Tweet 2:**
In 48 hours, we delivered:
- 50 fully researched leads
- Fit scores for every prospect
- Trigger events (why reach out NOW)
- Personalized cold emails
- 3-step follow-up sequences
- 6 ICP segments, 3 regions

Not contacts. Intelligence.

**Tweet 3:**
The sales tool industry sells data access.

But data without context is a spreadsheet.

Local businesses don't need 10,000 contacts. They need 50 perfect ones — scored, ranked, and ready to close.

That's the difference between a tool and a system.

**Tweet 4:**
Result: Client cancelled HubSpot, Apollo, AND ZoomInfo.

$3,600/year saved. Better leads. Less work.

If you're a dentist, lawyer, or HVAC company still manually prospecting — DM me "LEADS" and I'll show you what this looks like for your business.

Most businesses are paying $1,200/mo for tools that give them spreadsheets.

We built a client an AI-powered dashboard that delivers fully researched, scored leads with personalized outreach — for $200/mo.

50 leads in 48 hours. Fit scores. Trigger events. Cold emails written. Follow-up sequences loaded.

They cancelled HubSpot. Cancelled Apollo. Cancelled ZoomInfo.

$3,600/year saved. Better results. One dashboard.

### Facebook Post

True story from this week:

A client came to me frustrated. They were paying for HubSpot ($50/mo), Apollo ($99/mo), and ZoomInfo ($1,000+/mo) — over $1,200 every month — and still spending hours manually researching prospects.

So I built them something different.

One AI-powered dashboard. $200/mo. And in the first 48 hours, it delivered 50 fully researched leads with:
- Fit scores (so they know who to call first)
- Trigger events (so they know WHY to call now)
- Personalized cold emails (ready to send)
- Follow-up sequences (3 steps, already written)

Six different customer segments. Three different regions. All in one place.

They cancelled all three tools. That's $3,600 back in their pocket this year — and they told me the leads are actually better than what they were getting before.

If you run a local business and you're tired of paying for tools that don't deliver, I'd love to show you what this looks like. Drop a comment or shoot me a message.
