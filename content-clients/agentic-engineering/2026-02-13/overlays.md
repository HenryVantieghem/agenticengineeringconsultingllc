## Overlay Timeline

### 0:00 - 0:05 | HOOK
**Text:** `$1,200/mo --> $200/mo`
**Position:** Center screen, large font
**Animation:** Pop in on "twelve hundred," morph/transition on "$200"
**Note:** This is the scroll-stopper. Make it big and impossible to miss.

### 0:05 - 0:10 | PROBLEM SETUP
**Text:** `"We need leads but we're drowning in tools"`
**Position:** Lower third
**Animation:** Fade in with quotation marks
**Note:** Keep it as a quote — it's the client's voice.

### 0:10 - 0:15 | THE BUILD
**Text:** `1 Custom Dashboard`
**Position:** Center
**Animation:** Clean fade in
**Subtext (smaller):** `AI-Powered`

### 0:15 - 0:22 | THE NUMBERS
**Text sequence (stacked, appearing one by one):**
1. `50 Leads`
2. `48 Hours`
3. `Fit Scores + Trigger Events`
4. `Cold Emails + Follow-ups`
**Position:** Left-aligned stack
**Animation:** Each line slides in from left, 1 second apart
**Note:** This is the proof. Let each number land.

### 0:22 - 0:28 | SCOPE
**Text:** `6 Segments | 3 Regions`
**Position:** Center
**Animation:** Fade in
**Subtext (smaller):** `Scored & Ranked`

### 0:28 - 0:35 | THE RESULT
**Text sequence (appearing one by one with strikethrough):**
1. `~~HubSpot~~ Cancelled`
2. `~~Apollo~~ Cancelled`
3. `~~ZoomInfo~~ Cancelled`
**Position:** Center, stacked
**Animation:** Each tool name appears, then gets struck through with "Cancelled" appearing in red/accent
**Note:** This is the punchline. Pause for effect on each one.

### 0:35 - 0:38 | SAVINGS
**Text:** `$3,600/year saved`
**Position:** Center, large
**Animation:** Pop in with emphasis
**Color:** Green or accent color for the dollar amount

### 0:38 - 0:45 | CTA
**Text:** `See what this looks like for YOUR business`
**Position:** Lower third
**Subtext:** `Link in bio`
**Animation:** Fade in, hold until end

## Production Notes

- **Font:** Use a modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or Montserrat)
- **Colors:** White text primary, accent color (#00d4ff) for numbers and dollar amounts, red for "Cancelled"
- **Background:** If possible, have the actual dashboard visible on a laptop/screen behind Henry during the body section (0:10-0:35)
- **Pacing:** Let each overlay breathe for at least 1.5 seconds. Don't rush the numbers.
- **Audio:** No background music needed for talking head. If adding, keep it subtle and corporate (not hype-y).
- **Aspect ratios to produce:**
  - 9:16 (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) — primary
  - 1:1 (LinkedIn feed, Instagram feed) — secondary
  - 16:9 (YouTube, LinkedIn video) — optional
