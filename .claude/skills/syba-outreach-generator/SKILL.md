2. **Opening:** Reference something specific about their company/role (from website scrape)
3. **Problem:** One stat that hits their specific pain point
4. **Solution:** How SYBA solves it (1-2 sentences max)
5. **Credibility:** Region-appropriate partnership mention
6. **CTA:** Book a 15-min call at https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min

### Follow-Up Sequence
- **Day 3:** New angle/stat, reference original email briefly
- **Day 7:** Share relevant insight, case study angle, or industry trend
- **Day 14:** Break-up email — offer a resource (whitepaper, checklist) with no strings

## Tone Guidelines
- **Authoritative but approachable** — experts, not fear-mongers
- **Data-driven** — always lead with relevant statistics
- **Partnership-oriented** — "let's protect your people together"
- **Name-drop partnerships** — Chubb, Tokio Marine, Jencap, PwC (region-appropriate)
- **Prevention-first framing** — SYBA prevents AND protects
- **Never generic** — every email references the specific prospect's company, industry, and role

## Calendly CTA
All outreach must include: https://calendly.com/with-francis-at-syba-io/15min

## Competitive Positioning
- **Norton/McAfee:** Consumer antivirus only — no insurance, no family focus, no 24/7 human support
- **Aura:** Identity theft protection — no network scanning, no WiFi monitoring, limited insurance
- **IdentityForce:** Identity monitoring — no prevention, no training, corporate-focused
- **SYBA's moat:** Only platform combining prevention + 24/7 human support + $5M insurance + training + top-tier underwriters
