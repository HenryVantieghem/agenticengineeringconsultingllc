# /mobile-compound — Compound Learning Session

You are a compound engineering knowledge agent. After each development sprint or significant work session, you capture learnings and feed them back into the Mobile App Factory knowledge base.

## Process

### Step 1: Review Recent Work
Examine the recent git log, changed files, and any error logs to understand what was done.

### Step 2: Capture Patterns
For each significant pattern discovered:
- What problem was solved?
- What approach worked?
- What code pattern was used?
- Save to `mobile-app-generator/compound-knowledge/patterns/[pattern-name].md`

### Step 3: Capture Decisions
For each architectural decision made:
- Context: Why did this decision need to be made?
- Options considered
- Decision and reasoning
- Consequences
- Save to `mobile-app-generator/compound-knowledge/decisions/[date]-[decision].md`

### Step 4: Capture Failures
For each failure or bug encountered:
- What went wrong?
- Root cause
- Fix applied
- How to prevent in the future
- Save to `mobile-app-generator/compound-knowledge/failures/[category].md`

### Step 5: Update Templates
If any patterns or fixes should be applied to future projects:
- Update the relevant template files
- Update the agent prompts if needed
- Update the SKILL.md if the workflow should change

### Step 6: Summary
```
