## Email Body

Hi [First Name / "there"],

I was looking at [Business Name] on Google and noticed you have [rating] stars — clearly your customers love what you do.

Here's something I've seen with [industry] businesses in Auburn: **up to 62% of calls go unanswered** during busy hours, lunch breaks, and after 5pm. And 85% of those callers never call back — they just call the next [industry] on Google.

I built an AI phone system that answers every call to your business, 24/7. It sounds natural, knows your services and hours, books appointments directly to your calendar, and texts you a summary after every call.

**It costs less than one missed appointment per month.**

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call this week? I can show you exactly how it works with a live demo.
