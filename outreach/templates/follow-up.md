# Follow-Up Sequence — Agentic Engineering / LeadDrop

## Follow-Up #1 (Day 3 after initial contact)

**Subject:** Following up — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Just following up on the leads I sent over [day]. Quick question — did any of those five prospects look like a good fit?

I run these daily for businesses like yours in [City]. If you want to see what 20 scored, researched leads landing in your inbox every morning looks like, I can show you the full dashboard in 15 minutes.

Here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/henryvantieghem-agenticengineeringconsultingllc/30min

Either way, those leads are yours to keep.

Best,
Henry

## Follow-Up #2 (Day 7 after initial contact)

**Subject:** One more thing — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Last quick note — I ran the numbers for [industry] businesses in [City]:

The average [industry] practice spends $1,200/mo on HubSpot + Apollo + ZoomInfo and still spends 3 hours/day researching prospects manually. My system replaces all three tools for $200/mo and delivers 20 scored leads to your dashboard every morning — zero manual research.

One of my clients cancelled all three subscriptions and saved $3,600/year before counting the hours.

If the timing isn't right, no worries. But if you're curious: https://calendly.com/henryvantieghem-agenticengineeringconsultingllc/30min

Talk soon,
Henry

## Follow-Up #3 (Day 14 after initial contact — final touch)

**Subject:** Closing the loop — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

I'll take the hint — timing might not be right, and that's totally fine.

I'm keeping a list of [industry] businesses in [City] I'd love to work with, and [Business Name] is on it. If you ever feel like you're spending too much time finding clients instead of serving them, just reply to this email or book a time here: https://calendly.com/henryvantieghem-agenticengineeringconsultingllc/30min

Wishing you a great week,
Henry
