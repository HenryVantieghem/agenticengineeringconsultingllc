# Follow-Up Sequence — Agentic Engineering Consulting

## Follow-Up #1 (3 days after initial contact)

**Subject:** Following up — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note from [day]. I know [industry] gets busy, so I'll keep this short:

I'd love to show you a 10-minute demo of how our AI phone system works for [industry] businesses. No pitch — just a live demo so you can hear it in action.

Here's my calendar if you want to grab a time: [Calendly link]

Best,
Henry

## Follow-Up #2 (7 days after initial contact)

**Subject:** One more thing — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Last note from me — I promise.

I ran some numbers for [industry] businesses your size in Auburn: the average business loses about $4,500/month from missed calls. That's appointments that go to competitors, questions that don't get answered, and after-hours leads that slip through.

Our system catches all of that for less than $500/month.

If the timing isn't right, no worries. But if you're curious, here's a 10-minute demo slot: [Calendly link]

Talk soon,
Henry

## Follow-Up #3 (14 days after initial contact — final touch)

**Subject:** Closing the loop — [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

I'll take the hint — timing might not be right, and that's totally fine.

I'm keeping a list of [industry] businesses in Auburn I'd love to work with, and [Business Name] is on it. If you ever feel like you're losing calls or want to explore automation, just reply to this email or book a time here: [Calendly link]

Wishing you a great [season],
Henry
