# Phone Call Script — Agentic Engineering Consulting

## Opening (10 seconds)

"Hi, is this [Name / the owner]? This is Henry from Agentic Engineering — I'm a local tech company here in Auburn. I had a quick question about your phone system, do you have 60 seconds?"

## Hook (20 seconds)

"I work with [industry] businesses in the area, and one thing I keep hearing is that it's hard to answer every phone call — especially during [busy time: appointments / showings / jobs / court]. Does that sound familiar?"

**[LISTEN — let them talk. This is where you learn their pain.]**

## Bridge (15 seconds)

"That's exactly what I hear from a lot of [industry] owners. Here's the thing — I built an AI system that answers your phone 24/7. It sounds like a real person, knows your services and hours, and books appointments right to your calendar. Your callers never hit voicemail again."

## Close (15 seconds)

"Would you be open to seeing a quick 10-minute demo? I can show you exactly how it sounds and what it does. No commitment — just want to show you what's possible."

**If YES:** "Perfect — I'll send you a link to book a time. What email should I send it to?"
**If MAYBE:** "Totally get it. Can I just send you a quick email with more info? What's the best address?"
**If NO:** "No worries at all. If you ever feel like you're missing calls, just Google 'Agentic Engineering Auburn' — we'll be there."

## Objection Handling

### "What does it cost?"
"Our plans start at $497/month — less than what most businesses lose from just a few missed calls. But let me show you the demo first so you can see if it's a fit."

### "I already have a receptionist / answering service"
"That's great — this isn't about replacing anyone. It's about catching the calls they can't get to. Lunch breaks, after hours, holidays, when all lines are busy. Think of it as backup that never calls in sick."

### "I'm not interested in AI"
"Totally understand — a lot of our clients felt the same way at first. The way I think about it: your customers don't know it's AI. They just know someone answered. Want to hear a quick demo call? It might surprise you."

### "Let me think about it"
"Of course — I'll shoot you a quick email with a link to our demo. If you ever want to chat, I'm right here in Auburn."
